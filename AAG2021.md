## Discussion: budget, awards, etc. 
* there is $1000 in the budget currently
  * Our income is generally ~$1500 a year from membership dues
* Worked great to have a panel with student award winners: let's continue that!
* Recently had another Twitter chat, moderated by guest moderator Avery Everhart
  *  Peter got Avery a $25 gift card in thanks--if we have budget for that, it would be a great thing to continue dedicating a small amount of funds for, given that the guest moderators tend to be early career folks
* Funds for keynote speakers (especially if they are non-geographers) can come from the AAG Enrichment Fund (have to apply for these by Nov. 7 each year): http://www.aag.org/cs/enrichment
* Some discussion about how we probably don't need to keep a positive balance in the account--we can spend what we have each year, unless we want to develop a strategy for an endowment, but that is a bigger conversation
